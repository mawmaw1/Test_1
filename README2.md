## This is the metrics report after refactoring

After refactoring the code, the cyclomatic complexity decreases from 6 to 1, and the maintainability increases from 104 to 136.
The cyclomatic complexity in the metrics-tool, is a count of the number of cycles in the program flow control graph. Effectively the number of distinct paths through a block of code. Lower is better. (https://github.com/escomplex/escomplex/blob/master/METRICS.md)

## Smartbear-checklist

The checklist helps programmers to make better code reviews. It explains that you should take the code reviews seriously and spend time on it, but also that you shouldn't spend too much time and look at too much code in a single review, since this will decrease efficiency. It is also important that the team checks up on bugs after having found them, so they actually will be fixed. Generally the checklist is very positive about code reviews, and explains that if the programmer has these code reviews in mind all the time, he will create better code since he knows others will review it.


## Coding standards
 
Simple code
Since you might not be the last person to work on the code that you write, you should make sure that your code is easily read and kept as simple as possible.
Commenting
It is important to comment in your code whereever it makes sense, to increase understanding of the code.
Naming
It is important for the team to agree on a standard for naming variables etc. Something that makes sense for the first person, may not make sense to the next person. So having self-explanatory variables is important.
 
 
## Highlights from lecture
 
It is extremely important to test early, since it is cheapest for the company to fix bugs in the early stages. The later a bug is spotted, the more expensive it will become to fix.
It is a general misunderstanding that the agile manifesto says that you shouldn't focus on documentation/testing etc, since these are also important factors for developing a system.
Testing generally is extremely important, and everyone tests. Not just the testers, but the developers should also be testing their own software during development.
